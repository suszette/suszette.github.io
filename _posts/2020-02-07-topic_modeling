changed to 30, and ran it


output: different generated topics when ran for 20 topics. also words as „jpriv“, „wpriv“, „apriv“ starting to show up - don’t know where they came from. plus things like „th“, „va“ and „st“ also showed up. maybe should be included in filling words, since those generate no reliable topics.
