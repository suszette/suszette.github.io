	title = {Thought {Experiments}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entrieshought-experiment/},
	abstract = {Thought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They areemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,conceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,theory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversialthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve toillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used ineducational contexts. The situation is different, however, withrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigatereality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,tables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and evendivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attractsmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.Significant is the overlap here with many other central philosophicaltopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance ofunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition inhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.Moreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two importantrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers treat them as a topic, butalso historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc. Secondly,they can be found in many disciplines, including biology, economics,history, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,interestingly, not with the same frequency in each)., Most often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,frequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between theimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on theone hand, and the narratives that establish the scenarios inpeople’s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it mayassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative powerof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain thatactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion ofan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should bedistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imaginingany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and frompsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be someoverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactualreasoning in general, as they seem to require an experimental element(i.e., visualized, touched, heard, etc.), which explains theimpression that something is experienced in a thought experiment(Brown 1991 [2011]). In other words, though many call anycounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,e.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing. It is a quitedifferent matter as to whether there is a logical structure common toall of thought experiments. Based on considerations of logicalstructure, a taxonomy has been proposed according to which all thoughtexperiments fall into two classes: “Necessity Refuters”and “Possibility Refuters” (see Sorensen 1990,132–160). Such proposals especially fuel the debate aboutidentity conditions of thought experiments. What modifications tological structure does a thought experiment tolerate before it ceasesto exist and a new one is born? In other words, how much emphasis onpropositional characteristics in appropriate is the analysis ofthought experiments?, Looking at the development of the discussion about thought experimentsover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experimentswere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and thephilosophy of philosophy (“metaphilosophy”), before thescope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for thatpath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simpleepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerfulmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science hasto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world byvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can welearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking in such away? Are there really thought experiments that enable us to acquirenew knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If so, wheredoes the new information come from if not from contact with the realmof investigation under consideration in an imagined scenario? Finally,how can we distinguish good from bad instances of thought experiments?These questions seem urgent with respect to scientific thoughtexperiments, because many “recognize them as an occasionallypotent tool for increasing our understanding of nature.…Historically their role is very close to the double one played byactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thoughtexperiments can disclose nature’s failure to conform to a previouslyheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particular ways inwhich both expectation and theory must henceforth be revised.”(Kuhn 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions surrounding theepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experimentspose are also urgent regarding thought experiments outside of thesciences. This is especially true with respect to philosophy itself.Philosophy offers numerous examples of thought experiments that play arole similar in importance to some scientific thought experiments. Andthis fact provokes in turn further inquiries into the relationshipbetween the sciences and philosophy, especially with respect tophenomena that implicate both the sciences and philosophy, such as themind (see Wilkes 1988; Young 2013).,  If scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then thequestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology tobe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is oftenoffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may besubjected to further empirical testing. This can’t be done forphilosophical thought experiments. It seems difficult to accept such acategorical separation of science and philosophy. The 17th century sawsome of the most brilliant practitioners of thought experimentation inGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz, all of whom pursued theproject of “natural philosophy.” And in our own time, thecreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkablewithout the crucial role played by thought experiments, most of whichrelate to important philosophical issues that arise from thesescientific theories. Besides, much of ethics, philosophy of language,and philosophy of mind is based on the results of thought experimentsin a way that seems very similar to scientific thought experiments(though some might contest this), including Searle’s Chinese room,Putnam’s twin earth, and Jackson’s Mary the colourscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severelyimpoverished without thought experiments. These observations partlyexplain why it has been argued that a more “unified” account ofthought experiments is desirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005,pp. 329–330; Gähde 2000). Of course, it is important not todownplay the significant differences between the sciences andphilosophy. But an account of thought experiments seems more powerfulif it can do justice to the fact that not only in the sciences we findmany of them., There have been several attempts to define “thoughtexperiment” along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better toleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice theongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to whatthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (seeHäggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to beginwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficientconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal withremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,religion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to referto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well asthose already mentioned, there are Newton’s bucket, Heisenberg’sgamma-ray microscope, Einstein’s elevator, Leibniz’s mill, Parfit’speople who split like amoebas, and Thomson’s violinist. Everyone isprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thoughtexperiments include the mouse that breaks into the tabernacle of amedieval Roman Catholic Church building to feed on the consecratedwafers in there (see Fehige 2011). Roman Catholic Christians believethat a consecrated wafer is the body of Christ. The “substance” of thewafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed tobe replaced. In its place is the “substance” of Christ’s body afterconsecration by a priest. Only the Aristotelian “accidents” of thewafer remain intact (smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eatthe body of Christ (if any human actually does)? Another example is“the dome”which is to prove indeterminism in Newtonianphysics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetric surface in agravitational field. Guided by Newton’s laws of motion one comes torealize that the mass can either remain at rest for all times, orspontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). Thisthought experiment triggers a number of very interesting questionsconcerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,of course, does it show what it claims? (see Malament 2008)., In the following we will first provide a characterization of thoughtexperiments in light of examples. A proposal follows for classifyingthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate onthought experiments as such, preceded by some remarks about thehistory of philosophical inquiry into the nature of thoughtexperiments. We conclude by highlighting some trends in discussionssurrounding the so-called laboratory of the mind.},

	abstract = {Mental simulation is the simulation, replication or re-enactment, usually in imagination, of the thinking, decision-making, emotional responses or other aspects of the mental life of another person. According to simulation theory, mental simulation in imagination plays a key role in our everyday psychological understanding of other people. The same mental resources that are used in our own thinking, decision-making or emotional responses are redeployed in imagination to provide an understanding of the thoughts, decisions or emotions of another.
            Simulation theory stands opposed to the ’ theory theory’ of folk psychology. According to the theory theory, everyday psychological understanding depends on deployment of an empirical theory or body of information about psychological matters, such as how people normally think, make decisions or respond emotionally. Simulation theory does not altogether deny that third-personal psychological knowledge is implicated in our folk psychological practice, prediction, interpretation and explanation. But it maintains that, over a range of cases, the first-personal methodology of mental simulation allows us to avoid the need for detailed antecedent knowledge about how psychological processes typically operate.},

	abstract = {Nelson Goodman was an American philosopher who wrote important works in metaphysics, aesthetics and epistemology. Throughout his work runs a concern with the ways that the symbols we construct inform the facts that we find, and structure our understanding of them. Different symbol systems yield irreconcilable structures. So there is no one way things really are. There are, he concludes, many worlds if any. Moreover, worlds are made rather than found, for the categories we construct fix the criteria of identity for the individuals and kinds we recognize. Thus they determine what objects and kinds constitute a world.
            Goodman argues that the arts as well as the sciences make and reveal worlds. Aesthetics as he construes it is a branch of epistemology. He analyses a variety of modes of symbolization, literal and metaphorical, and shows how they contribute in the arts and elsewhere to the advancement of understanding.
            Goodman’s ‘new riddle of induction’ reveals that the problem of induction runs deeper than philosophers had thought. He defines the predicate ‘grue’ as ‘examined before future time t and found to be green or not so examined and blue.’ All emeralds examined to date have been both green and grue. What justifies our expecting future emeralds to be green rather than grue? Inductive validity, the new riddle shows, turns not only on the constitution of an evidence class, but also on its characterization. The question then is what favours one characterization over its rivals. The fact that ‘green’ has been used far more often than ‘grue’ in induction, Goodman contends, provides the answer – not because it increases our odds of being right, but because of its pragmatic advantages.},

It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and itis experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this knowledge.Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its important roles isto test theories and to provide the basis for scientific knowledge.[1] It can also call for a new theory, either byshowing that an accepted theory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a newphenomenon that is in need of explanation. Experiment can provide hintstoward the structure or mathematical form of a theory and it canprovide evidence for the existence of the entities involved in ourtheories. Finally, it may also have a life of its own, independent oftheory. Scientists may investigate a phenomenon just because it looksinteresting. Such experiments may provide evidence for a future theoryto explain. [Examples of these different roles will be presentedbelow.] As we shall see below, a single experiment may play several ofthese roles at once., If experiment is to play these important roles in science then wemust have good reasons to believe experimental results, for science isa fallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,or the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.Science is more complex than “The scientist proposes, Nature disposes.”It may not always be clear what the scientist is proposing. Theoriesoften need to be articulated and clarified. It also may not be clearhow Nature is disposing. Experiments may not always give clear-cutresults, and may even disagree for a time., In what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment,a set of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimentalresults. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on theseexperimental results.},

	abstract = {Thought experiments are strange: they have the power to present surprising results and can profoundly change the way we view the world, all without requiring us to examine the world in the way that ordinary scientific experiments do. Philosophers who view all hypothetical reasoning as a form of thought experimentation regard the method as being as old as philosophy itself. Others maintain that truly informative thought experiments are found only in mathematics and the natural sciences. These emerged in the seventeenth century when the new experimental science of Bacon, Boyle, Galileo, Newton and others forced a distinction between the passive observation of Aristotelian mental narratives and the active interventions of real-world experiment. The new science gave rise to a philosophical puzzle: how can mere thought be so informative about the world? Rationalists argue that thought experiments are exercises in which thought apprehends laws of nature and mathematical truths directly. Empiricists argue that thought experiments are not exercises of ‘mere thought’ because they actually rely upon hidden empirical information – otherwise they would not count as experiments at all. More recently it has been argued that thought experiments are not mysterious because they are constructed arguments that are embedded in the world so as to combine logical and conceptual analysis with relevant features of the world.},

Model aeroplanes and other scale models share selected structural properties with their originals, while differing in other properties, such as construction materials and size. Analogue models, which resemble their originals in some aspect of structure or internal relations, are important in the sciences, because they can facilitate inferences about complicated or obscure natural systems. A collection of billiard balls in random motion is an analogue model of an ideal gas; the interactions and motions of the billiard balls are taken to represent – to be analogous to – the interactions and motions of molecules in the gas.
            In mathematical logic, a model is a structure – an arrangement of objects – which represents a theory expressed as a set of sentences. The various terms of the sentences of the theory are mapped onto objects and their relations in the structure; a model is a structure that makes all of the sentences in the theory true. This specialized notion of model has been adopted by philosophers of science; on a ‘structuralist’ or ‘semantic’ conception, scientific theories are understood as structures which are used to represent real systems in nature. Philosophical debates have arisen regarding the precise extent of the resemblances between scientific models and the natural systems they represent.},

	abstract = {The psychologist William James observed that "a native talent for perceiving analogies is ... the leading fact in genius of every order." The centrality and the ubiquity of analogy in creative thought have been noted again and again by scientists, artists, and writers, and understanding and modeling analogical thought have emerged as two of the most important challenges for cognitive science. Analogy-Making as Perception is based on the premise that analogy-making is fundamentally a high-level perceptual process in which the interaction of perception and concepts gives rise to "conceptual slippages" which allow analogies to be made. It describes Copycat - a computer model of analogy making, developed by the author with Douglas Hofstadter, that models the complex, subconscious interaction between perception and concepts that underlies the creation of analogies. In Copycat, both concepts and high-level perception are emergent phenomena, arising from large numbers of low-level, parallel, non-deterministic activities. In the spectrum of cognitive modeling approaches, Copycat occupies a unique intermediate position between symbolic systems and connectionist systems a position that is at present the most useful one for understanding the fluidity of concepts and high-level perception. -- Publisher description.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to explain why people become confused by questions about the relation between menal and physical events. When a question leads to confused, inconsistent answers, this may be (1) because the question is ultimately meaningless or at least unanswerable, but it may also be (2) because an adequate answer requires a powerful analytical apparatus. My view is that many important questions about relation between mind and brain are of this latter kind, and that some of the necessary technical and conceptual tools are becoming available as a result of work on he problems of making computer programs behave intelligently. In this paper we suggest a theory of why introspection does not give clear answers to these questions. The paper does not go very far toward finding technical solutions to the questions, but there is probably some value in finding at least a clear explanation of why we are confused.},

Smith identifies two kinds of models that play an important role, where specifications are models of problems and programs are models of possible solutions. Both presuppose the existence of conceptualizations as ways of conceiving the world “in certain delimited ways.” But high-level programming languages also function as models of virtual (or abstract) machines, while low-level programming languages function as models of causal (or physical) machines. The resulting account suggests that sets of models embedded within models are indispensable for computer programming.},

As an alternative to these perspectives, Williams defends his own distinctive contextualist approach.

I then criticize the view according to which the difference between models/simulations and experiments is fundamentally epistemic in character. Following Herbert Simon, I argue that the difference is ontological. Simulations merely require the existence of an abstract correspondence between the simulating and the simulated system. In experiments, in contrast, the causal relations governing the experimental and the target systems are grounded in the same material. Simulations can produce new knowledge just as experiments do, but the prior knowledge needed to run a good simulation is not the same as that needed to run a good experiment. I conclude by discussing “hybrid” cases of “experimental simulations” or “simulating experiments”.},

	title = {Thought {Experiments}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entrieshought-experiment/},
	abstract = {Thought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They areemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,conceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,theory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversialthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve toillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used ineducational contexts. The situation is different, however, withrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigatereality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,tables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and evendivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attractsmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.Significant is the overlap here with many other central philosophicaltopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance ofunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition inhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.Moreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two importantrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers treat them as a topic, butalso historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc. Secondly,they can be found in many disciplines, including biology, economics,history, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,interestingly, not with the same frequency in each)., Most often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,frequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between theimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on theone hand, and the narratives that establish the scenarios inpeople’s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it mayassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative powerof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain thatactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion ofan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should bedistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imaginingany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and frompsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be someoverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactualreasoning in general, as they seem to require an experimental element(i.e., visualized, touched, heard, etc.), which explains theimpression that something is experienced in a thought experiment(Brown 1991 [2011]). In other words, though many call anycounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,e.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing. It is a quitedifferent matter as to whether there is a logical structure common toall of thought experiments. Based on considerations of logicalstructure, a taxonomy has been proposed according to which all thoughtexperiments fall into two classes: “Necessity Refuters”and “Possibility Refuters” (see Sorensen 1990,132–160). Such proposals especially fuel the debate aboutidentity conditions of thought experiments. What modifications tological structure does a thought experiment tolerate before it ceasesto exist and a new one is born? In other words, how much emphasis onpropositional characteristics in appropriate is the analysis ofthought experiments?, Looking at the development of the discussion about thought experimentsover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experimentswere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and thephilosophy of philosophy (“metaphilosophy”), before thescope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for thatpath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simpleepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerfulmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science hasto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world byvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can welearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking in such away? Are there really thought experiments that enable us to acquirenew knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If so, wheredoes the new information come from if not from contact with the realmof investigation under consideration in an imagined scenario? Finally,how can we distinguish good from bad instances of thought experiments?These questions seem urgent with respect to scientific thoughtexperiments, because many “recognize them as an occasionallypotent tool for increasing our understanding of nature.…Historically their role is very close to the double one played byactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thoughtexperiments can disclose nature’s failure to conform to a previouslyheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particular ways inwhich both expectation and theory must henceforth be revised.”(Kuhn 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions surrounding theepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experimentspose are also urgent regarding thought experiments outside of thesciences. This is especially true with respect to philosophy itself.Philosophy offers numerous examples of thought experiments that play arole similar in importance to some scientific thought experiments. Andthis fact provokes in turn further inquiries into the relationshipbetween the sciences and philosophy, especially with respect tophenomena that implicate both the sciences and philosophy, such as themind (see Wilkes 1988; Young 2013).,  If scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then thequestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology tobe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is oftenoffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may besubjected to further empirical testing. This can’t be done forphilosophical thought experiments. It seems difficult to accept such acategorical separation of science and philosophy. The 17th century sawsome of the most brilliant practitioners of thought experimentation inGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz, all of whom pursued theproject of “natural philosophy.” And in our own time, thecreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkablewithout the crucial role played by thought experiments, most of whichrelate to important philosophical issues that arise from thesescientific theories. Besides, much of ethics, philosophy of language,and philosophy of mind is based on the results of thought experimentsin a way that seems very similar to scientific thought experiments(though some might contest this), including Searle’s Chinese room,Putnam’s twin earth, and Jackson’s Mary the colourscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severelyimpoverished without thought experiments. These observations partlyexplain why it has been argued that a more “unified” account ofthought experiments is desirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005,pp. 329–330; Gähde 2000). Of course, it is important not todownplay the significant differences between the sciences andphilosophy. But an account of thought experiments seems more powerfulif it can do justice to the fact that not only in the sciences we findmany of them., There have been several attempts to define “thoughtexperiment” along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better toleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice theongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to whatthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (seeHäggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to beginwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficientconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal withremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,religion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to referto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well asthose already mentioned, there are Newton’s bucket, Heisenberg’sgamma-ray microscope, Einstein’s elevator, Leibniz’s mill, Parfit’speople who split like amoebas, and Thomson’s violinist. Everyone isprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thoughtexperiments include the mouse that breaks into the tabernacle of amedieval Roman Catholic Church building to feed on the consecratedwafers in there (see Fehige 2011). Roman Catholic Christians believethat a consecrated wafer is the body of Christ. The “substance” of thewafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed tobe replaced. In its place is the “substance” of Christ’s body afterconsecration by a priest. Only the Aristotelian “accidents” of thewafer remain intact (smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eatthe body of Christ (if any human actually does)? Another example is“the dome”which is to prove indeterminism in Newtonianphysics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetric surface in agravitational field. Guided by Newton’s laws of motion one comes torealize that the mass can either remain at rest for all times, orspontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). Thisthought experiment triggers a number of very interesting questionsconcerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,of course, does it show what it claims? (see Malament 2008)., In the following we will first provide a characterization of thoughtexperiments in light of examples. A proposal follows for classifyingthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate onthought experiments as such, preceded by some remarks about thehistory of philosophical inquiry into the nature of thoughtexperiments. We conclude by highlighting some trends in discussionssurrounding the so-called laboratory of the mind.},

'Representing' deals with the different philosophical accounts of scientific objectivity and the reality of scientific entities. The views of Kuhn, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Putnam, van Fraassen, and others, are all considered. 'Intervening' presents the first sustained treatment of experimental science for many years and uses it to give a new direction to debates about realism. Hacking illustrates how experimentation often has a life independent of theory. He argues that although the philosophical problems of scientific realism can not be resolved when put in terms of theory alone, a sound philosophy of experiment provides compelling grounds for a realistic attitude. A great many scientific examples are described in both parts of the book, which also includes lucid expositions of recent high energy physics and a remarkable chapter on the microscope in cell biology.},

I identify three shifts of interest in the treatment of the topic of scientific models. First, only from the 1950s did models begin to be considered relevant to the scientific enterprise, motivated by the desire to account for issues such as theory change and creativity in scientific discovery. Second, I examine how philosophers then increasingly concentrated on the analysis of the functions of models, e.g. for explanation or for guiding and suggesting new experiments. Finally, I show how an analysis of the functions of models could lead to the consideration of their function not just within science, but also in human cognition, so that models are now sometimes viewed as tools of actual (rather than logically reconstructed) scientific thinking.},

Model aeroplanes and other scale models share selected structural properties with their originals, while differing in other properties, such as construction materials and size. Analogue models, which resemble their originals in some aspect of structure or internal relations, are important in the sciences, because they can facilitate inferences about complicated or obscure natural systems. A collection of billiard balls in random motion is an analogue model of an ideal gas; the interactions and motions of the billiard balls are taken to represent – to be analogous to – the interactions and motions of molecules in the gas.
            In mathematical logic, a model is a structure – an arrangement of objects – which represents a theory expressed as a set of sentences. The various terms of the sentences of the theory are mapped onto objects and their relations in the structure; a model is a structure that makes all of the sentences in the theory true. This specialized notion of model has been adopted by philosophers of science; on a ‘structuralist’ or ‘semantic’ conception, scientific theories are understood as structures which are used to represent real systems in nature. Philosophical debates have arisen regarding the precise extent of the resemblances between scientific models and the natural systems they represent.},

	shorttitle = {The {Literary} {Mind}},
	abstract = {We usually consider literary thinking to be peripheral and dispensable, an activity for specialists: poets, prophets, lunatics, and babysitters. Certainly we do not think it is the basis of the mind. We think of stories and parables from Aesop's Fables or The Thousand and One Nights, for example, as exotic tales set in strange lands, with spectacular images, talking animals, and fantastic plots--wonderful entertainments, often insightful, but well removed from logic and science, and entirely foreign to the world of everyday thought. But Mark Turner argues that this common wisdom is wrong. The literary mind--the mind of stories and parables--is not peripheral but basic to thought. Story is the central principle of our experience and knowledge. Parable--the projection of story to give meaning to new encounters--is the indispensable tool of everyday reason. Literary thought makes everyday thought possible. This book makes the revolutionary claim that the basic issue for cognitive science is the nature of literary thinking. In The Literary Mind, Turner ranges from the tools of modern linguistics, to the recent work of neuroscientists such as Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman, to literary masterpieces by Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Proust, as he explains how story and projection--and their powerful combination in parable--are fundamental to everyday thought. In simple and traditional English, he reveals how we use parable to understand space and time, to grasp what it means to be located in space and time, and to conceive of ourselves, other selves, other lives, and other viewpoints. He explains the role of parable in reasoning, in categorizing, and in solving problems. He develops a powerful model of conceptual construction and, in a far-reaching final chapter, extends it to a new conception of the origin of language that contradicts proposals by such thinkers as Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. Turner argues that story, projection, and parable precede grammar, that language follows from these mental capacities as a consequence. Language, he concludes, is the child of the literary mind.Offering major revisions to our understanding of thought, conceptual activity, and the origin and nature of language, The Literary Mind presents a unified theory of central problems in cognitive science, linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. It gives new and unexpected answers to classic questions about knowledge, creativity, understanding, reason, and invention.},

                The psychologist William James observed that "a native talent for perceiving analogies is... the leading fact in genius of every order." The centrality and the ubiquity of analogy in creative thought have been noted again and again by scientists, artists, and writers, and understanding and modeling analogical thought have emerged as two of the most important challenges for cognitive science. Analogy-Making as Perception is based on the premise that analogy-making is fundamentally a high-level perceptual process in which the interaction of perception and concepts gives rise to "conceptual slippages" which allow analogies to be made. It describes Copycat - a computer model of analogymaking, developed by the author with Douglas Hofstadter, that models the complex, subconscious interaction between perception and concepts that underlies the creation of analogies. In Copycat, both concepts and high-level perception are emergent phenomena, arising from large numbers of low-level, parallel, non-deterministic activities. In the spectrum of cognitive modeling approaches, Copycat occupies a unique intermediate position between symbolic systems and connectionist systems a position that is at present the most useful one for understanding the fluidity of concepts and high-level perception. On one level the work described here is about analogy-making, but on another level it is about cognition in general. It explores such issues as the nature of concepts and perception and the emergence of highly flexible concepts from a lower-level "subcognitive" substrate.},

	abstract = {Nelson Goodman was an American philosopher who wrote important works in metaphysics, aesthetics and epistemology. Throughout his work runs a concern with the ways that the symbols we construct inform the facts that we find, and structure our understanding of them. Different symbol systems yield irreconcilable structures. So there is no one way things really are. There are, he concludes, many worlds if any. Moreover, worlds are made rather than found, for the categories we construct fix the criteria of identity for the individuals and kinds we recognize. Thus they determine what objects and kinds constitute a world.
            Goodman argues that the arts as well as the sciences make and reveal worlds. Aesthetics as he construes it is a branch of epistemology. He analyses a variety of modes of symbolization, literal and metaphorical, and shows how they contribute in the arts and elsewhere to the advancement of understanding.
            Goodman’s ‘new riddle of induction’ reveals that the problem of induction runs deeper than philosophers had thought. He defines the predicate ‘grue’ as ‘examined before future time t and found to be green or not so examined and blue.’ All emeralds examined to date have been both green and grue. What justifies our expecting future emeralds to be green rather than grue? Inductive validity, the new riddle shows, turns not only on the constitution of an evidence class, but also on its characterization. The question then is what favours one characterization over its rivals. The fact that ‘green’ has been used far more often than ‘grue’ in induction, Goodman contends, provides the answer – not because it increases our odds of being right, but because of its pragmatic advantages.},

The informative, nontechnical chapters written especially for this book describe many of the areas of computer science critical to the design of intelligent machines, discuss whether scientists in the 1960s were accurate about the prospects for advancement in their fields, and look at how HAL has influenced scientific research.Contributions by leading scientists look at the technologies that would be critical if we were, as Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrick imagined thirty years ago, to try and build HAL in 1997: supercomputers, fault-tolerance and reliability, planning, artificial intelligence, lipreading, speech recognition and synthesis, commonsense reasoning, the ability to recognize and display emotion, and human-machine interaction. A separate chapter by philosopher Daniel Dennett considers the ethical implications of intelligent machines.},

The principles Mark Monmonier outlined back then remain true today, despite significant technological changes in the making and use of maps. The introduction and spread of digital maps and mapping software, however, have added new wrinkles to the ever-evolving landscape of modern mapmaking. Fully updated for the digital age, this new edition of How to Lie with Maps examines the myriad ways that technology offers new opportunities for cartographic mischief, deception, and propaganda. While retaining the same brevity, range, and humor as its predecessors, this third edition includes significant updates throughout as well as new chapters on image maps, prohibitive cartography, and online maps. It also includes an expanded section of color images and an updated list of sources for further reading.},

	abstract = {"The map is not the territory" is a cartographic truism. It means that unless the map is drawn on a mile-to-mile scale and has the same physical characteristics as the territory itself, it cannot be perfectly accurate. But as David Turnbull demonstrates, the map is a metaphor not only for the territory it represents but for the culture that created it. As such, it takes on the meaning of the territory and its importance in that culture.In this ingenious book, Turnbull challenges common assumptions about the nature of cartography. In each of ten "exhibits" he addresses a seemingly basic concept—that a map is be factually accurate, for example, or that its symbols refer to concrete elements of the landscape—and then illustrates its complexities with maps from Western, Asian, and native cultures, from prehistoric to modern times, accompanied by quotations and historical background. The "exhibits" show how different cultures express their relation to the land, and how those differences ultimately define not only territory but also domination—religious, ideological, cultural, and political.An ideal introduction to the concepts of cartography, this book teaches not only how to read maps, but how to read them between the lines.},

	abstract = {Let's step back to the year 1978. Sony introduces hip portable music with the Walkman, Illinois Bell Company releases the first mobile phone, Space Invaders kicks off the video game craze, and William Kent writes Data and Reality. We have made amazing progress in the last four decades in terms of portable music, mobile communication, and entertainment, making devices such as the original Sony Walkman and suitcase-sized mobile phones museum pieces today. Yet remarkably, the book Data and Reality is just as relevant to the field of data management today as it was in 1978. Data and Reality gracefully weaves the disciplines of psychology and philosophy with data management to create timeless takeaways on how we perceive and manage information. Although databases and related technology have come a long way since 1978, the process of eliciting business requirements and how we think about information remains constant. This book will provide valuable insights whether you are a 1970s data-processing expert or a modern-day business analyst, data modeler, database administrator, or data architect.This third edition of Data and Reality differs substantially from the first and second editions. Data modeling thought leader Steve Hoberman has updated many of the original examples and references and added his commentary throughout the book, including key points at the end of each chapter. The important takeaways in this book are rich with insight yet presented in a conversational writing style. Here are just a few of the issues this book tackles:Has "business intelligence" replaced "artificial intelligence"?Why is a map's geographic landscape analogous to a data model's information landscape?Where do forward and reverse engineering fit in our thought process?Why are we all becoming "data archeologists"?What causes the communication chasm between the business professional and the information technology professional, and how can the logical data model bridge this gap?Why do we invest in hardware and software to solve business problems before determining what the business problems are in the first place?What is the difference between oneness, sameness, and categories?Why does context play a role in every design decision?Why do the more important attributes become entities or relationships?Why do symbols speak louder than words?What's the difference between a data modeler, a philosopher, and an artist?Why is the 1975 dream of mapping all attributes still a dream today?What influence does language have on our perception of reality? Can we distinguish between naming and describing?From Graeme Simsion's foreword:While such fundamental issues remain unrecognized and unanswered, Data and Reality, with its lucid and compelling elucidation of the questions, needs to remain in print. I read the book as a database administrator in 1980, as a researcher in 2002, and just recently as the manuscript for the present edition. On each occasion I found something more, and on each occasion I considered it the most important book I had read on data modeling. It has been on my recommended reading list forever. The first chapter in particular should be mandatory reading for anyone involved in data modeling. In publishing this new edition, Steve Hoberman has not only ensured that one of the key books in the data modeling canon remains in print, but has added his own comments and up-to-date examples, which are likely to be helpful to those who have come to data modeling more recently. Don't do any more data modeling work until you've read it.},

I will also argue that these challenges would be best addressed by a philosophy of science that places less emphasis on the representational capacity of theories (and ascribes that capacity instead to models) and more emphasis on the role of theory in guiding (rather than determining) the construction of models.

	abstract = {Physics, and natural science in general, is a reasonable enterprisebased on valid experimental evidence, criticism, and rationaldiscussion. It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and itis experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this knowledge.Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its important roles isto test theories and to provide the basis for scientific knowledge.[1] It can also call for a new theory, either byshowing that an accepted theory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a newphenomenon that is in need of explanation. Experiment can provide hintstoward the structure or mathematical form of a theory and it canprovide evidence for the existence of the entities involved in ourtheories. Finally, it may also have a life of its own, independent oftheory. Scientists may investigate a phenomenon just because it looksinteresting. Such experiments may provide evidence for a future theoryto explain. [Examples of these different roles will be presentedbelow.] As we shall see below, a single experiment may play several ofthese roles at once., If experiment is to play these important roles in science then wemust have good reasons to believe experimental results, for science isa fallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,or the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.Science is more complex than “The scientist proposes, Nature disposes.”It may not always be clear what the scientist is proposing. Theoriesoften need to be articulated and clarified. It also may not be clearhow Nature is disposing. Experiments may not always give clear-cutresults, and may even disagree for a time., In what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment,a set of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimentalresults. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on theseexperimental results.},
