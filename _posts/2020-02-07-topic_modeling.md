title: topic modeling with jupyter notebook

changed to 30 and ran it:

![topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suszette/suszette.github.io/master/img/02.png)

output: different generated topics compared to when ran for 20 topics. also words as „jpriv“, „wpriv“, „apriv“ starting to show up - don’t know where they came from. plus things like „th“, „va“ and „st“ also showed up. maybe should be included in filling words, since those generate no reliable topics.
