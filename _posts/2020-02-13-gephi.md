so first you have to collect all relevant items. for this we would say it’s place names, theire frequencies and the article (exact date) in which they appear.

the places names would be the nodes, the articles the edges and the frequencies the weight. which this information you can create a network that shows you how different place names relate to each other and considering their frequencies how important a place during a certain period of time was.

since we were just not able to generate a code on our own, we found this from a girl who attended your class last semester on the internet. this would generate information like this:

dataset1

![dataset1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suszette/suszette.github.io/master/img/dataset1.png)

so, the source is the article, the target the placename (tgn) and their frequencies . 

then another code which generated the actual placenames plus theire longitute and latitute. 

dataset2
![dataset2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suszette/suszette.github.io/master/img/dataset2.png)

when we imported dataset2 into gephi, nothing happend - of course, because there where no edges.
![gephi2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suszette/suszette.github.io/master/img/gephi_01.png)


adding dataset1 into gephi:
![gephi1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suszette/suszette.github.io/master/img/gephi_02.png)

a network shows. so this must be a network showing the different place names connected by the articles, but we are not sure what the longitude and latitude-data is doing there, if it does anything at all. and we also don’t know what the frequencies (weight) is doing here in this particular network.
